 qingqiu_federation.1.t:0 "The Federation of Qingqiu"
 qingqiu_federation.1.d:0 "The Status of the Federation"
 qingqiu_federation.1.f:0 "The Federation of Qingqiu is by no means a well-functioning federation. Our provinces have a great level of autonomy, having differing laws and even their own armies, making governance from  difficult. The provinces are actively working against our federation, making it tough to pass laws and taking a share of the taxes imposed on our people for themselves! However the federation is not without benefits, with our long history of federalism, beginning in the 1600s, we have found what works for the Qingqiuan people. Yet now the question remains; We must reform, but how? Do we reform our federation, or begin a new era as a unitary state?"
 qingqiu_federation.1.a:0 "We must choose our path carefully"
 qingqiu_federation.2.t:0 "The Great Qingqiu Flood of 1862!"
 qingqiu_federation.2.d:0 "The Flood"
 qingqiu_federation.2.f:0 "Two months of rain, snow and sleet have battered the hinterland of Qingqiu, coating the Dongji Mountains in a thick blanket of snow. Now thunder dominates the sky along the mountains in an intense winter storm, bringing in an unusual warmth from the south. The culmination of this has resulted in a flood of monumental proportions, great waves of snow-melt washed down the down the valleys of the Dongji Mountains, flooding the fertile valley that lay across Qingqiu and Shangu Siwang, before finally reaching the streets of Jinhe, Yingzhou and Sanbao! With our agricultural heartland flooded under great tracts of water, telegraph poles deep underwater and our people suffering, it is clear that we must make quick and decisive, yet careful action to avoid a greater crisis. Wether or not we have reformed our nation, we must move forwards and stop the suffering of our people!"
 qingqiu_federation.2.a:0 "We must begin recovery immediately"
 qingqiu_federation.3.t:0 "The Federation of Qingqiu"
 qingqiu_federation.3.d:0 "Success: A Reformed Federation"
 qingqiu_federation.3.f:0 "After years of careful manouvers within our government, pitting the provinces against each other and even considerate military reform in order to further our cause and prolong the success of the Federation! Now after years of struggles we have finally finished with our reforms, the provinces are now demilitarised and serve the people rather than the governors, our people no longer view themselves as Sanbaoers or Dayanites and instead see themselves as Qingqiuian! Now that we have bought stability to the federationn, we can continue onwards and face the enemies that dare threaten our Federation!"
 qingqiu_federation.3.a:0 "Our federation may live on for another century!"
 qingqiu_federation.4.t:0 "The State of Qingqiu"
 qingqiu_federation.4.d:0 "Success: The end of the Federation"
 qingqiu_federation.4.f:0 "After years of careful manouvers within our government, we have successfully curbed the influence of the states, making the system functionally obsolete! Finally our nation will be stable, we have the oportunity to liberalise and progress, finally the Qingqiuian people won't need to bend the knee to corrupt governors and endure thier backwards ways. Direct governance from Sanbao begins now, in the name of the people!"
 qingqiu_federation.4.a:0 "We walk forwards into a new era, united as one!"
 qingqiu_flood.15.tt:0 "We can only hope that this is enough"
 qingqiu_federation.5.t:0 "Completion of the Cross-Dayan Railway!"
 qingqiu_federation.5.d:0 "After many weeks of hard and grueling work by our valiant builders, we've finally completed the railway across Dayan, linking Changfeng and Sanbao!"
 qingqiu_federation.5.f:0 "Weaving through the mountains, past the gold fields of Dayan and along the Grey River, stretches a band of wood and steel, seemlingly endless should you stand in the middle of it. As the first train begins its journey from Sanbao to Changfeng, our railway builders sit back in Sanbao, proudly looking down the line as the joint Golden Sleeper monuments are built in Sanbao and Changfeng. Now eager passangers and prospectors in Sanbao stand at the platform waiting for the next train to bring them to the goldfields out west, creating a new wave of migration in Qingqiu!"
 qingqiu_federation.5.a:0 "Onwards to Changfeng!"

 qingqiu_federation.6.d:0 ""Qingqiu itself was nothing but a fraudulent state, that is clear. Yet now I wonder, will I lead Xiazhou to a similar fate?""
 qingqiu_federation.6.f:0 "On the site of the former Juban District, begins the construction of a government building, shovels breaking the dirt as people gather in the a hotel converted into a temporary government house. Inside sits a nervous Jun Iwasaki, the current head of Xiazhou, only in charge by slim chance, and perhaps unluckily. Iwasaki never expected to lead the city she called home, yet with the death of her father and prominent Sanbao League member, Yuji Iwasaki and older brothers in the floods of Sanbao, Jun Iwasaki now finds herself as the last capable member of the still powerful Iwasaki trading family. However now the newly formed Japanese-dominated Xiazhou League expects great things from her, along with the non-Japanese Xiazhouans, yet with increased Japanese presence and a growing power base, tensions are building between the powerful Japanese minority and the Xiazhouans, neither of which hope for a return to 1818... Now Iwasaki leads an increasingly tense Xiazhou, as someone never intended to be little more than someone standing politely in the background, with little experience, she must bring her best for Xiazhou!"

 qingqiu_federation.11.d:0 "Piece by piece, day by day, body by body, Sanbao moves slowly in these dark days, a city in decay."
 qingqiu_federation.11.f:0 "A city dragged through hell and left to live for eternity in a pool of stagnant, bloodstained water. Whether the city itself is to blame or the people in it, justice is served in the end, with both meeting their demise in watery graves with no remorse. As the city around us crumbles, we can only wander the streets with those that have lost it all, uprighting fallen shelves and pretending that the smell isn't as bad as it really is. The valley behinds us screams no more, the farmers fall silent as the waterlogged feilds only serve as the resting places for all those that toiled within them, the remnants of Jinhe wash out into the valley as the only thing the valley has left to provide. The symbol of Qingqiu, the catalyst of the rebellion against the foreign invaders, the trading capital of Qingqiu, a city incomparable to any other, now lies in ruin, dead in the water as it lays with the people that inhabited it. Sanbao is dead and so is everything in it."

 qingqiu_federation.13.f:0 "Nestled in the hills along the Grey River and amongst the White Mulberry trees that stay low to the ground in the parched sun, a little town sits on what used to be a profitable gold mine. Now unkown anywhere else but in the small communities of Dayan, the town struggles without food, gold meaning nothing more than the dead bushes and dry dirt underfoot. Cut off by the Mingxing Shan in the Dayan Basin lay many towns, identical to this one, deliberately unmarked by the governers loyal to Sanbao, in order to take their five kilos of gold and burn the maps, lining their pockets and turning their back to those they claim to love. Dayan has always been seen more as a neighbour to the coast, not an equal, just something a little too out of the way to be convenient, a threat to the federation as its dry interior potentially convene with the Lusitanians, planning another Spanish conquest of Qingqiu! These lies will be heard no more in Dayan!"

 qingqiu_federation.15.f:0 ""The State", the Lusitanian term for Qingqiu, its overgovernance on us Lusitanians and the denail of our independence! A state rotten to its very core, and one that we will never turn back gaze upon again! The Lusitanian people under Qingqiu are at once as they should be! Yet we cannot celebrate just yet, our brothers to the south may be faring differently to us, we should reach out to them if they will listen, or at the very least those that rule them, for hopes we can seek protection from the mess left behind."

 qingqiu_federation.16.d:0 ""Gentlemen, as we find ourselves at the head of Changfeng and all of Yicheng, I'd like to thank those nominated, may the voting commence!""
 qingqiu_federation.16.f:0 "The Plantegenian 600 would rise to prominence within the new Yicheng as their connections in Nouvelle Orléans funnel money into their deep pockets. And with that, came power. The Industrial State of Yicheng, as it became known, ruled by eccentric men in fancy suits with the best interests of their wallet in mind. The people of Yicheng need not worry however, at least that's what the 600 say, however a journey under the 600 may lead to a repeat of the Silence of Sanbao..."

 #Flood Chain
 
 qingqiu_flood.1.t:0 "Swift Actions"
 qingqiu_flood.1.d:0 "With the valley flooded and our towns underwater, we must take action immediately!"
 qingqiu_flood.1.f:0 "The valley has been the most badly affected area of the entire country, with its large fields and pastures it's obvious that we cannot standby idly by whilst our people suffer! As of now, our farmers are struggling to stay afloat, we have recieved reports that some of them have been clinging to telegraph poles in order to stay above water, every day that passes will only result in more casualties. Reports have also come from towns in the valley regarding people stranded on rooftops with what little they have left, rescuing them would take time but result in a brief economic slowdown!"
 qingqiu_flood.1.a:0 "Rescue the farmers and reestablish supply routes to the towns!"
 qingqiu_flood.1.b:0 "Rescue the farmers and townspeople using merchant ships!"
 qingqiu_flood.1.c:0 "Reestablish supply routes to the towns in order to save the people!"
 qingqiu_flood.2.t:0 "The Matter of the Provinces"
 qingqiu_flood.2.d:0 "With the crisis situated in Sanbao, the question lingers; what to do about the other provinces?"
 qingqiu_flood.2.f:0 "Sanbao, the valley and the cities of the valley are the most affected, now the governers of the provinces turn their eyes to Sanbao, wondering what actions to take. Whilst we have recieved many telegraphs and letters of mourning and hope from our governors, we must give them a statement on how to move forwards. We already have several proposals, the most popular in Sanbao being to impose new taxes on the provinces, funneling money into Sanbao - and likely into corrupt bureaucrat's pockets too - to fund the recovery efforts. Alternatively, temporarily granting further autonomy to the provinces would mean that they can manage themselves and we can manage the flood recovery efforts. However we also have the option of not responding at all, obviously this would not be the ideal course of action, but what other choices do we have?"
 qingqiu_flood.2.a:0 "Impose new taxes on the provinces"
 qingqiu_flood.2.b:0 "Temporarily grant more autonomy to the provinces"
 qingqiu_flood.2.c:0 "Send no response! The status-quo can remain"
 qingqiu_flood.3.t:0 "The Matter of the rest of the country"
 qingqiu_flood.3.d:0 "With the crisis in Sanbao, the question lingers; how should the rest of the country support Sanbao in this crisis?"
 qingqiu_flood.3.f:0 "Sanbao, the valley and the cities of the valley are the most affected, now the rest of our nation turns its eyes to Sanbao, wondering what further actions we will take. Whilst we have recieved many telegraphs and letters of mourning and hope from local officials, we must give our people a statement on any further actions we take. We have several proposals, the most popular in our government being to temporarily impose a new tax to fund further recovory efforts, funneling money into Sanbao. Alternatively, a suggestion to establish the Qingqiu State Disaster Response Ministry has been suggested, whilst this would put a strain on our already dwindling resources, it will make sure that we never suffer as we have suffered over these past months by preventing any such disaster occuring in future! We also have the option of not taking any further action, as of now things are under control and we have the luxury of choice in this situation."
 qingqiu_flood.3.a:0 "Establish the Disaster Response Ministry and put it to action immediately!"
 qingqiu_flood.3.b:0 "Temporarily impose a new tax to raise more funds"
 qingqiu_flood.3.c:0 "We will endure with what we have already"
 qingqiu_flood.4.t:0 "The Matter of the Provinces"
 qingqiu_flood.4.d:0 "With the crisis situated in Sanbao, the question lingers; what to do about the other provinces?"
 qingqiu_flood.4.f:0 "People are worried that our government is still in the midst of reforms and we are not capable of sending any response to our governors! Xiazhou resident and prominent member of the Sanbao League, Yuji Iwasaki has gathered support to promote the idea that Xiazhou should become the new capital of the federation, this idea has been hotly debated in Sanbao however, yet in times like this, we will take any ideas and advice being offered. Likewise has the idea that we temporarily delegate more liberties to the provinces whilst we struggle to reach into the furthest corners of the provinces and our nation, whilst this would allow us to dedicate all our time and resources, it would mean a weakened grip on the federation for some time. Some members of our government have also suggested that we ultimately do nothing, for the Federation of Qingqiu will endure!"
 qingqiu_flood.4.a:0 "Delegate more power to the Provinces"
 qingqiu_flood.4.b:0 "Xiazhou shall be our new capital!"
 qingqiu_flood.4.c:0 "We are strong, the Federation will survive!"
 qingqiu_flood.5.t:0 "The Levees of Sanbao and the Valley"
 qingqiu_flood.5.d:0 "Our great system of canals and levees, whilst built to prevent diasters, has only come to prolong the presence of floodwaters! We must address this!"
 qingqiu_flood.5.f:0 "The complex and intricate system of irrigation channels, ditches, canals and rivers in the valley were built over the span of several centuries, they serve to both irrigate the large swathes of farmland, as well as mitigate any minor floods and surges. However now this dense system of waterways is only stifling our efforts! The canals are full of silt and irrigation ditches only let more water wash into vast crop feilds and pastures! We could break the levees to relieve the valley somewhat, however this would mean that we would need to take some time to rebuild them, likely affecting our agricultural throughput for a few years. Whilst it may be more expensive and more difficult, we could dig temporary drainage channels through the farmland in order to quickly flush out a large portion of the floodwaters. Of course, simply letting nature take its course is an option too, perhaps the flood waters will receed overtime?"
 qingqiu_flood.5.a:0 "Break the levees - they will provide the most relief!"
 qingqiu_flood.5.b:0 "We don't need to take action here"
 qingqiu_flood.5.c:0 "Dig drainage channels, we cannot let this water remain any longer!"
 qingqiu_flood.6.t:0 "Beginning the Reconstruction"
 qingqiu_flood.6.d:0 "Even now as people wade through water in the streets of Sanbao and towns of the valley, we must begin to rebuild"
 qingqiu_flood.6.f:0 "Having resources imported from the north and east and our funding secured, we can begin rebuilding from the ground up. Unfortunately we are only missing the labor, many people from all across the Valley and Sanbao are occupied with picking up the pieces and what little they have left, we have so few people that can work for us! We need workers, it seems that the obvious choice would be sending our soldiers in to help rebuild, they are well trained and perhaps the force that's the most dedicated to our country! Some members of our government have proposed putting our prisoner populace to use though, even if we must force them to work for us. The final realistic choice we have is recruiting farmers from the Valley to rebuild, starting with their towns, unfortunately this will likely slow down our agricultural industries."
 qingqiu_flood.6.a:0 "Put the prisoners to use, it's all they're good for!"
 qingqiu_flood.6.b:0 "Send in our soldiers, they are the best equipped for dealing with this!"
 qingqiu_flood.6.c:0 "Recruit the farmsers from the valley!"
 qingqiu_flood.7.t:0 "Fate of the Shantytowns"
 qingqiu_flood.7.d:0 "Shantytowns; the dwellings of people lowest on the social ladder, they must be addressed, for their sake!"
 qingqiu_flood.7.f:0 "Towns built out of nothing but scraps and what little spare materials could be found are filled with our poorest citizens, now with the floodwaters lapping at their haphazardly constructed doors, we cannot sit by any longer and let our-worst off people suffer like this! Currently we have two proposals - rebuild the towns on higher ground near the cities, or build new towns and relocate the shantytowners there instead. However, these both come at a price, one that perhaps may be too high for us, leaving us with little choice but to let the shantytowners fend for themselves..."
 qingqiu_flood.7.a:0 "Construct new homes for them in any space possible!"
 qingqiu_flood.7.b:0 "Relocate them to outside the city in new towns"
 qingqiu_flood.7.c:0 "Leave them to their fate - we have nothing to spare for them"
 qingqiu_flood.8.t:0 "Christians Offer Aid"
 qingqiu_flood.8.d:0 "With the ongoing crisis, several religious groups of primarily Christians have come forward offering to help our ailing people"
 qingqiu_flood.8.f:0 "Several more prominent Christian groups have come forwards, bringing with them food and all the services that come with a large group of able-bodied people. Whilst Christians are tolerated, some of our more zealous citizens fear the Christians and are skeptical of their motives, however these people tend to be the minority. Whatever their motives may be, they have come before us and have already made smaller efforts to assist the worst-off already, the time has come to address their presence; shall we accept their help, or turn them away?
 qingqiu_flood.8.a:0 "We accept their aid, we will take all the help we can get"
 qingqiu_flood.8.b:0 "This is nothing but a ploy to push their religion!"
 qingqiu_flood.9.t:0 "A Telegram to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName]?"
 qingqiu_flood.9.d:0 "Gran Colombia; the only country that we can turn to, despite our relationship with the Colombians, asking for help seems to be our only option"
 qingqiu_flood.9.f:0 "To our north, the Japanese, hostile and looking for any opportunity to strike, like a vulture to a corpse. To the West, the Franks across the Mingxing Shan, only able to send too little too late. But to our south, the Colombians, their nation has been through many hardships, we have struggled against the same enemy and live on Arcadian together, yet the conflict over the Lusitanian lands has put a strain on our relationship. Regardless, we shall turn to them, hoping that they are willing to give us even a little to help us. At least for now, that is our only option, other than sending them nothing at all."
 qingqiu_flood.9.a:0 "Send the telegram, only the Colombians can save us"
 qingqiu_flood.9.b:0 "This was a silly proposal, they cannot help us"
 qingqiu_flood.10.t:0 "The Qingqiu Federation Sends us a Telegram"
 qingqiu_flood.10.d:0 "1862 has not looked upon Qingqiu kindly, sending them a great flood to the agricultural heartland of their nation, leaving their people suffering. They have turned to us, seeking help"
 qingqiu_flood.10.f:0 ""We as Qingqiuans have struggled together with the Colombians, standing side-by-side like brothers as we fight for our nation, our people and each other. The Qingqiuan people are now suffering once more, an immense flood has drowned Sanbao Valley, turning towns into nothing but wet piles of wood, showing no mercy to the farmers and townspeople, much like the Spanish did to us during our combined struggle against them. We come to the Gran Colombians again, seeking aid in our struggle, whilst our relationship has been strained over the Lusitanian question, we ask that the Colombians see past this issue and show magnanimity as they have before." - an excerpt from the telegram reads."
 qingqiu_flood.10.a:0 "We struggled as brothers before, we shall help the Qingqiuan people again"
 qingqiu_flood.10.b:0 "They are little but fools for thinking that we will give them any aid"
 qingqiu_flood.11.t:0 "The Colombian Response"
 qingqiu_flood.11.d:0 "Recalling our nations' shared history and brushing aside our conflicts, the Colombians have agreed to send us aid!"
 qingqiu_flood.11.f:0 ""The Colombians and Qingqiuans fought alongside each other, abandoning our brothers is simply not an option! The Colombian people will provide what we can to the Qingqiuan people, the Colombian people wish our Qingqiuan brothers the best fortunes in this crisis" - the opening lines of the response. With the aid the Colombians are providing us along with a small division of their authorities, our people will surely suffer no longer! However, we should now consider ourselves to be in Colombia's debt."
 qingqiu_flood.11.a:0 "Words cannot express our gratitude!"
 qingqiu_flood.12.t:0 "The Colombian Response"
 qingqiu_flood.12.d:0 "Brushing aside our nations' shared history and recalling our conflcits, the petty Colombians have refused to send us aid!"
 qingqiu_flood.12.f:0 ""We commend the bravery of the Qingqiuan diplomats for sending us such a message and we shall stop there. The Colombian Government will provide no aid for the Qingqiuan people, we have our own reasoning and we believe that our money would be better spent on our own people and interests." - A portion of the response from the Gran Colombian telegram. It is clear that the Colombians have decided to drive a wedge between us, whether it be because they have thier own problems or are simply too selfish. An unfortunate outcome, to be sure."
 qingqiu_flood.12.a:0 "This will only serve to drive a wedge between our nations"
 qingqiu_flood.13.t:0 "An Industrialist Offers Aid!"
 qingqiu_flood.13.d:0 "A prominent Plantegenian industrailist from Dayan has offered us a large sum of money to help with the recovery efforts"
 qingqiu_flood.13.f:0 "Maurice Flachant; a Plantegenian man who found his wealth in the gold fields of Dayan and later investing in primarily infrastructure throughout the Mingxing Shan, amassing a large fortune and becoming a prominent personality within Dahuang as well as wider region of Dayan. Following his arrival in Sanbao and seeing both this as a chance to expand his businesses as well as assist in the recovery efforts, he has made us an offer, giving us a sum of money to help with the recovery, as well as rebuilding much of the lost infrastructure, which would be owned by Mr. Flachant of course!"
 qingqiu_flood.13.a:0 "A fantastic investment!"
 qingqiu_flood.14.t:0 "The Fresh Water Problem"
 qingqiu_flood.14.d:0 "Fresh water has become harder to find as rivers and piping has been decimated by the floodwater"
 qingqiu_flood.14.f:0 "Before the flood, people in the cities and towns would find water in their taps, others further large amounts of infrastructure would take their water from the streams, rivers and channels of the valley. Yet now as the waters receed, our water infrastructure has been devastated! We could invest in a better and more durable system of aqueducts, however they would be expensive, unlike simply extracting water from whatever clean rivers can find! Some people from coastal communities have began to boil seawater in order to make fresh water, maybe we can tell our people to do the same?"
 qingqiu_flood.14.a:0 "Find clean rivers and take it from there!"
 qingqiu_flood.14.b:0 "Invest in a large system of aqueducts"
 qingqiu_flood.14.c:0 "Tell people to boil seawater!"
 qingqiu_flood.15.t:0 "Long-Term Rebuilding"
 qingqiu_flood.15.d:0 "Now with the worst behind us, we are left to pick up the pieces that lay around us"
 qingqiu_flood.15.f:0 "Finally the waters have become bearable, in many areas the water is little but a bad memory. The people of the valley and Qingqiu have provided all that they can to those suffering, now as we take the time to rebuild our towns, we must step in and help them out!"
 qingqiu_flood.15.a:0 "Give all that we can, make the reconstruction quick!"
 qingqiu_flood.15.b:0 "Proceed at a reasonable pace, let our people suffer no longer"
 qingqiu_flood.15.c:0 "Let us rebuild slowly, we cannot guarantee the stability of our coffers"
 qingqiu_flood.16.t:0 "No Reply from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName]"
 qingqiu_flood.16.d:0 "Sanbao has fallen silent and so have we, we have failed Qingqiu and its people"
 qingqiu_flood.16.f:0 "Whether it be our own ineptitude, the forces against us or all those who conspired to see the downfall of Qingqiu, we find ourselves with the blood on our hands as the country goes dark around us. The waters came and swept our towns away, swept our farms away and swept our people away, now so have we, sweeping the Qingqiu State into the footnotes of history as little more than just another failed attempt at a nation. Now as we slink back into the darkening depths of what remains, we have nothing to turn to as our people disown us, knowing that we were the ones to tear families apart and strip too many people of their livelihoods. Qingqiu is dead and we have killed it."
 qingqiu_flood.16.a:0 "The unitary experiment was a failure"
 qingqiu_flood.17.t:0 "No Reply from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName]"
 qingqiu_flood.17.d:0 "Sanbao has fallen silent and so have we, we have failed Qingqiu and its people"
 qingqiu_flood.17.f:0 "It was foolish to believe that a nation such as ours could survive this flood, with too little from the provinces and too ineffective of a government, it should have been clear form 1818 that we could not stand against anything. The waters run red with the blood of our people, perhaps if we had done things differently we could have prevented such a tradgedy, but we have only ourselves to blame. Now the provinces turn on us, realising that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] is nothing more than a sham! Leaving us behind as Qingqiu returns to its roots as a mess of states dotting the land, it is clear that the fate of our people is to be subjigated by others once more."
 qingqiu_flood.17.a:0 "We won against the Spanish and the Japanese, but not ourselves"
 qingqiu_flood.18.t:0 "The End of Our Woes"
 qingqiu_flood.18.d:0 "We have managed to escape one of the worst years Qingqiu has faced yet, this nothing but a triumph for Qingqiu and our people!"
 qingqiu_flood.18.f:0 "Through the commitment of our people, the charity of others and maybe even just a little bit of luck, Qingqiu has escaped the waters and lives on! Now we bare the scars of a great tragedy, despite this, our people take to the streets and celebrate as life returns to normal. We may finally lean back in our chairs as the disaster of 1862 fades into the background and will soon becoming nothing more than a page in the history book of Qingqiu!"
